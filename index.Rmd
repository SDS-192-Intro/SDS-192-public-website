Data science involves applying a set of strategies to transform a recorded set of values into something from which we can glean knowledge and insight. This course will introduce you to concepts and methods from the field of data science, along with how to apply them in R. You will learn how to acquire, clean, wrangle, and visualize data. You will also learn best practices in data science workflows, such as code documentation and version control. Issues in data ethics will be addressed throughout the course. 

Classes will be held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 10:50 AM to 12:05 PM. The first week of classes will be held virtually, and you can connect to our course via a link available on Moodle. Once in-person, we will meet in Ford 240. 

There are no prerequisites, but a willingness to write code is necessary. Coding for the first time can be intimidating, but I intend do everything in my power to support you through the learning curve and to make things both fun and relevant in the process. I personally picked up most of my data science skills through a lot of trial-and-error, practice, and curiosity. My hope is that, in this course, you will learn through experimentation, along with independent and collaborative problem-solving. Honing these competencies will serve you as you move on to other courses in the SDS program and/or at Smith.

:::

I am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.

### Getting in Touch

```{r}
bs_accordion(id = "connecting") %>%
  bs_set_opts(panel_type = "info", use_heading_link = TRUE) %>%
  bs_append(title = "Slack", content = includeMarkdown("md/slack.md")) %>%
  bs_set_opts(panel_type = "info") %>%
  bs_append(title = "Student Consultation Hours", content = includeMarkdown("md/office-hours.md")) 

```

## Course Texts

A number of excellent textbooks introducing data science concepts and methods have been written in the past few years, including a few from faculty in the Smith SDS department. To accompany the topics we will cover each week, I will be selecting my favorite chapters from these books and posting them to Perusall. However, all three books we will engage in this course cover almost every topic we will address, so feel free to supplement your reading with corresponding chapters in the other books: especially if you find yourself drawn to the teaching and writing style in a certain book. All books are available for free online. 

* Baumer, Benjamin S., Daniel T. Kaplan, and Nicholas J. Horton. 2021. *Modern Data Science with R*. 2nd ed. CRC Press. https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/.

* Irizarry, Rafael A. 2022. *Introduction to Data Science. Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R*. https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/.

* Ismay, Chester, and Albert Y. Kim. 2021. *Modern Dive: Statistical Inference via Data Science*. CRC Press. https://moderndive.com/.

Each week I will also list optional reading and resources in our course [schedule](schedule.html) that you may reference if you are struggling with a topic or if you wish to explore that topic further. I will update this list often throughout the semester. 

## Assessment

This course will be graded via a [standards-based assessment system](grading_contract.html).
