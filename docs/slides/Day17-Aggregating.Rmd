# A few reminders!

* Be sure to send me Slack messages vs. email. Feel free to follow-up if I haven't responded in 24 hours. ...but this only applies for weekdays! I try to focus on self-care on weekends.
* Ask questions via our `#questions` channel whenever possible
* Office hours on Mondays in McConnell 212; Wednesdays virtual
* Extension policy for quizzes

---

# Extra Credit

* If you did not get full credit on the following three standards:
  * Tracing Data Provenance
  * Data Fundamentals
  * Error Resolution and Problem-Solving

> I'm providing an extra credit opportunity to earn up to one point back per standard. Design a multiple choice quiz question that would demonstrate a student's understanding of that standard, using either the dataset from quiz 1 or quiz 2. Post it to the assignment in Moodle. Be sure to reprex() any code you produce for your question, and that there are five possible answers. Indicate the correct answer when submitting. 

---

# Preparing for Quiz 3

* From last quiz: Univariate Plotting, Visualization Aesthetics, Visualization Context
* Multivariate Plotting (how to interpret boxplots/how to interpret different types of stacked barplots/how to effectively perceive differences across categories)
* GitHub (GitHub vocabulary/how to resolve errors and conflicts)
* RMarkdown (Markdown syntax/code and output presentation)

---

# Tips for Quiz 3

* Be sure you understand *why* you may have not received full credit on questions in previous quizzes. Questions will be similar!
* Review the data documentation before you start the quiz. 
* Know the dataset's unit of observation before you start the quiz. 
* Read the question carefully (e.g. true/not true; select four, etc.)
* Whenever you can, copy and paste code to test it out in RStudio! Each question has everything you need to run the code in a code chunk. 
* Pay attention to my hints! Whenever there is risk that something might *trick* students, I've tried to provide a hint to steer you clear of that.

# Data wrangling is a process for transforming a dataset from its original form into a more relevant form.


---


class: center, middle
# **Subsetting** data involves selecting relevant variables and observations for analysis.

class: center, middle
# **Aggregating** data involves compiling and summarizing data.

# Six "verbs" for data wrangling

* `select()`
* `filter()`
* `arrange()`
* `summarize()`
* `group_by()`
* `mutate()`

# Today, we are going to perform a data analysis of beds available at different MA hospitals. How do you anticipate we go about doing this? What assumptions must we make?

---

# How many times does each hospital appear in this dataset?

```{r}
length(unique(hospitals$Provider.CCN)) == nrow(hospitals)
```

> Why might this be happening?

class: center, middle
# How are we going to deal with this issue? For the next few moments, talk with a neighbor about how you might approach this. Your approach can be high-level at first and the move towards technically specific. 

---

# `group_by()`

* `group_by()` groups observations with a shared value in a variable
* Grouping only changes the metadata of a data frame; we combine `group_by()` with other functions to transform the data frame
* Values remain in groups unless we `ungroup()` it. This is important if we intend to run further operations on the resulting data.

```{r}
hospitals <-
  hospitals %>%
  group_by(Provider.CCN) %>%
  filter(Fiscal.Year.End.Date == max(Fiscal.Year.End.Date)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

---

# Now let's filter to MA

```{r}
hospitals_ma <-
  hospitals %>%
  filter(State.Code == "MA")
```

# Summary functions

# `summarize()`

* `summarize()` computes a value across a vector of values and stores it in a new data frame

> How is this different than only applying a summary function to a vector?

---

# `summarize()`

* `summarize()` computes a value across a vector of values and stores it in a new data frame

```{r}
hospitals_ma %>%
  summarize(total_beds = sum(Number.of.Beds))
```

> Why did we get an `NA` value?

---

# `summarize()`

* `summarize()` computes a value across a vector of values and stores it in a new data frame
* `sum(is.na())` computes the total `NA` values in the vector

```{r}
hospitals_ma %>%
  summarize(total_beds = sum(Number.of.Beds, na.rm = TRUE), 
            total_beds_na = sum(is.na(Number.of.Beds)))
```

> What if I wanted to know the percentage of rows with `NA` values in the `Number.of.Beds` column?

---

# `summarize()`

* `summarize()` computes a value across a vector of values and stores it in a new data frame
* `n()` computes the total observations in the vector

```{r}
hospitals_ma %>%
  summarize(total_beds = sum(Number.of.Beds, na.rm = TRUE), 
            percent_beds_na = sum(is.na(Number.of.Beds)) / n() * 100)
```

# But there are very different types of hospitals represented in this dataset. Maybe I want to know the number of beds for each type of hospital.

# `group_by()` %>% `summarize()`

* `group_by()` groups observations with a shared value in a variable
* When we combine `group_by()` and `summarize()` we can perform operations *within* groups

# `mutate()`
