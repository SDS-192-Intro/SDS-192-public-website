I understand that you will sometimes need to prioritize other things over meeting assignment deadlines (e.g. your health, wellness, families, communities, jobs, other coursework). My late policy attempts to balance flexibility with accountability. There is a 24-hour grace period on all mini-project assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the mini-project within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any mini-project assignment, as long *as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date*. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted. 
  
However, except under extenuating circumstances, there are no extensions for take-home quizzes. I encourage you to start quizzes early and submit what you have by the deadline.
