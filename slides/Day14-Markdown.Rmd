## R Script
* Contain bare code for defining objects and running scripts
* All code in a file typically run at once from start to finish

.pull-right[
## R Markdown
* Includes features for writing reports and producing web pages with code
* Enables the author to style output in particular ways
* Modular: code snippets can be run one at a time in chunks

# R Markdown Scripting

* Text in R Markdown files is written in the Markdown markup language
* Markup languages communicate to a digital system how we want text and images displayed on the screen
* Allows us to assign certain words as headers, specify bullets, create tables, etc.
* Computational way of formatting text that we might otherwise format through WYSIWYG

# YAML

.pull-left[
* Metadata provided at the top of a R Markdown file
* Indicates how the file should be formatted
* Surrounded by `---`s

  * Etc.

# Code Chunks

.pull-left[
* Executable chunks of code are surrounded by <code>```</code>s
* We can insert R code as well as other languages
* We can run all code chunks from start to finish, or individually
* Ordering is important!]

.pull-left[
* `include = FALSE` code runs; but code and output don't appear in the final document
* `echo = FALSE` code runs and output appears in final document; but code doesn't appear in final document
* `message = FALSE` hides messages from the code in final output
* `warning = FALSE` hides warnings from the code in final output
